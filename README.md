Homework: Module 9 Challenge

## Short description: 

This challenge involves researching employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s, with the only remaining records from that period stored in six CSV files. The challenge consists of the following steps:

1. Data Modeling:

- Analyze the CSV files and design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to outline the required tables.

2. Data Engineering:

- Create table schemas based on the CSV data, defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relevant constraints.
- Ensure the correct order of table creation to maintain foreign key relationships.
- Import the data from the CSV files into the appropriate SQL tables.

3. Data Analysis:

- Extract essential employee details (e.g., employee number, name, salary).
- Identify employees hired in 1986 and those with the first name "Hercules" and last names beginning with "B".
- Gather information about department managers and their associated employees.
